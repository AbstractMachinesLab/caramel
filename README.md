# :candy: Caramel

![CI](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/caramel/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg)

Caramel is a functional language for building type-safe, scalable, and
maintainable applications.

Caramel leverages:

* the OCaml compiler, to provide you with a pragmatic type system and
  industrial-strength type safety.

* the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant
  systems used in a wide range of industries.
