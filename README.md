> :candy: An Erlang backend to the OCaml compiler

Core idea here is to grab a subset of OCaml, and turn it into valid, idiomatic
Erlang that you'd otherwise written by hand.

See: [./erlcomp/README.md](./erlcomp/README.md)

and: [./erlcomp/ROADMAP.md](./erlcomp/ROADMAP.md)

Check [./erltest](./erltest) for some examples of how the sources are being
compiled to erlang.
