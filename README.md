Caramel is a functional language for building type-safe, scalable, and
maintainable applications.

Caramel leverages:

* the OCaml compiler, to provide you with a pragmatic type system and
  industrial-strength type safety.

* the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant
  systems used in a wide range of industries.

## Feature Highlights

* Zero-cost type-safe interop with most existing Erlang and Elixir code
* Has a reviewed standard library included
* Supports sources in OCaml (and soon Reason syntax too)
* Ships a single executable (`caramel`)
* Has a built-in formatter (`caramel fmt`)
